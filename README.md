Welcome to Opinion8, an app designed to expower young people to form and voice their opinions on current issues.
- Inside the client folder of this repository you'll find a React app, which contains the frontend of the website (intended to be viewed on a mobile viewport).
- Inside the server folder you'll find a node application which connects to a MySQL database.

I wrote most of the front end code with occasional support from everyone's good friend ChatGPT - particularly with the Chart.js module and occasional CSS classes. The backend was created by mostly following along with these (excellent) tutorials from TechCheck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzF6FKB4VN3_8lYlLOsJI8hElGLRgUs7C. I would like to expand on the backend in future, however it is not fully complete due to time-constraints and my unfortunate lack of expertise in this area!
